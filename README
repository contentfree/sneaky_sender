sneaky_sender
=============

Use multiple email addresses to send large numbers of emails. Sneaky!


ABOUT 
=====
This module was inspired by Google Apps for Domains' sending limits and http://pastie.caboo.se/153510.
Google Apps for Domains limits the sending of email to 500 (or 100, depending on the FAQ) unique addresses
per day. That just doesn't cut it sometimes. Luckily, if you have a standard (free) account you can have
up to 200 email addresses. That's a significant number of emails per day (you should look at other
solutions if you start sending 10,000 emails every day)


USAGE 
=====
sudo gem install contentfree-sneaky_sender --source http://gems.github.com

Install the gem and in environments/production.rb (or config/initializers/mail.rb) set your
smtp_settings as normal except replace user_name with +multiple_user_names+ and give it an array
containing the following things:
* Email address template. Should contain a single %d that will be replaced with a number from the account
  number range. For example: 'notifications%d@domain.com'
* Account number range. A range - (1..20) for example - that will determine the email address to use. Will
  be replaced into the email address template and result in something like notifications1@domain.com
* (optional) Load balancing strategy. Either :random (default) or :round_robin. :random will use a random
  number from the range while :round_robin will start at the range.min and increment to range.max and
  continually loop back around. NOTE ABOUT ROUND ROBIN: This value isn't shared between mongrel instances.
